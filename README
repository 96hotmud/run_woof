Overview
========

run_woof is a wrapper that runs woof-CE in a Puppy Linux
(http://www.puppylinux.org/) chroot environment.

It allows:
  - Use of woof-CE on distributions other than Puppy itself
  - x86 Puppy development on x86_64
  - Safer use of woof-CE, without risk of contaminating the development
    environment

Usage
=====

To use run_woof:

  - If you are running Puppy Linux and have the 'devx' module loaded,
    run_woof will offer to use them, otherwise download your
    Puppy version of choice and its matching 'devx' module.

  - If you already have a woof-CE git repo, put run_woof in the same location,
    otherwise run_woof will offer to clone the woof-CE git repo for you.

  - run_woof is a ROX AppDir, if you use ROX as your file manager, just click
    on it to start it, otherwise you can click on the AppRun script inside the
    run_woof directory or run the ./run_woof_helper script in a terminal.  The
    original run_woof script can also be used directly, passing the paths to
    the ISO image, 'devx' module and directory with woof-CE

The directory passed to the run_woof script, or the directory where the
run_woof AppDir is located will be mounted at /root/share inside of run_woof.

The first time run_woof is started a run_woof.conf file will be created inside
of the run_woof AppDir with default settings based on the host operating
system.  These settings can be edited by clicking on "Configure run_woof" or if
the host operating system does not have gtkdialog, editing the run_woof.conf
file in a text editor.
