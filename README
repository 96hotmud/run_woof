Overview
========

run_woof is a wrapper that runs woof-CE in a Puppy Linux
(http://www.puppylinux.org/) chroot environment.

It allows:
  - Use of woof-CE on distributions other than Puppy itself
  - x86 Puppy development on x86_64
  - Safer use of woof-CE, without risk of contaminating the development
    environment

Usage
=====

To use run_woof:
  - Download your Puppy version of choice and its matching 'devx' module
  - Obtain the woof-CE codebase
  - Run run_woof; pass the paths to the ISO image, 'devx' module and woof-CE

The woof-CE directory will be mounted at /root/share.
